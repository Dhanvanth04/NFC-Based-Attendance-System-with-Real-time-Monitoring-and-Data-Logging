# NFC-Based-Attendance-System-with-Real-time-Monitoring-and-Data-Logging
The project aims to develop an embedded system utilizing NFC technology, along with attendance, 
distance, and count sensors, to create an automated attendance recording system. The system will 
integrate Arduino, ESP32, and WiFi modules to enable real-time monitoring and data logging. 
Attendance data will be updated in Google Sheets for easy access and analysis. Key challenges 
include sensor integration, system calibration, web interface development, and secure data 
transmission.
